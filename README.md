# rock_paper_scissors
My first JS project.

This project consist in a simple game of rock, papers and scissors. It will have a menu which directs to the game, the game will have 3 buttons to choose: rock, papers and scissors. The main objective is to beat the computer winning more than 5 games. The score will be in the same page as the game.
